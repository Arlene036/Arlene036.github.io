Start with wandb today
======
I found the previous method of tuning hyperparameters of GAT model that I used was not beautiful and time-consuming. I talked with Prof. Chen and he recommended me such parameter tuning tool! I quickly sign up for that website and start my parameter tuning trip! I ran my code in colab, and there are parameters of 2 models in 9 datasets (each with 2 mode) for me to tuning. I have to make the tuning process automatically!

`wandb.finish()` is a good method and it is necessary to avoid a lot of errors! I even encountered some errors like socket error... I just restarted the jupyter kernel and shut down the previous thread, and that worked.

I also worked on updating my website today! woo~

However, I have 2 midterm exams next week and 1 project to present right after them... I have to start doing right thing. Just do it and stop being sad~
